# share_mem

Example of interprocess communication (in Rust and in Go) with shared memory, lock free (with basic ring buffer for Rust and atomic ring buffer for Go) and zero copy.
The purpose of this is to obtain low latency interprocess communication and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this "technic".
